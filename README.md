# Strategic Retail Analytics: E-commerce Growth & Customer Retention

A comprehensive Business Analyst project leveraging the **Online Retail II** dataset to transform raw transactional data into actionable growth strategies.

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Business Analysis workflow. Using a dataset of ~1 million transactions, I identified high-value customer segments, analyzed revenue leakage from returns, and developed a strategic roadmap for a 15% increase in customer retention.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **RFM Segmentation:** Grouping customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- **Churn Risk Identification:** Pinpointing "At-Risk" VIPs before they leave.
- **Revenue Leakage Analysis:** Investigating the impact of cancelled orders and returns.
- **Stakeholder Documentation:** Professional BRD and KPI frameworks.
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Visual storytelling for executive decision-making.

## 🚀 Business Requirements (BRD Highlights)

**The Problem:** The business lacks visibility into customer loyalty. Marketing spend is currently "one-size-fits-all," leading to high CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and declining repeat purchases.

**The Solution:** Implement an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework to:
1. Identify the top 20% of customers generating 80% of revenue.
2. Automate "Win-back" campaigns for the 'At Risk' segment.
3. Reduce operational costs by identifying high-return product categories.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas/Seaborn):** For data wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **SQL:** To aggregate transactional logs into customer-level summaries.
- **Tableau:** To build the interactive Strategic Customer Dashboard.
- **Markdown:** For professional documentation and reporting.
